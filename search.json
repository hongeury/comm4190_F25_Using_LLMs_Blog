    "text": "I realized I am the only PhD student in this class. That motivated me to dive deeper into my PhD program at Annenberg. I tried two versions of chat.asc.upenn.edu, which I discovered after attending Professor Matt‚Äôs AI workshop a couple of days ago. The workshop was amazing, so I thought‚Äîwhy not do a little exploration of what I learned! I asked it what the good things are about the Annenberg PhD program. Let‚Äôs see what it gives. Also, I wasn‚Äôt familiar with the Haiku version‚Äîthe name gives off more poetic vibes, so I wanted to explore whether that‚Äôs true or not. We shall see.\n\n\nPrompt Generation onchat.asc.upenn.edu 3.5-haiku vs.¬†gpt4o\n1st, 2nd, 3rd tiral with the same prompt of: what is good thing about upenn annenberg phd\n  \n\n\nüìä Comparison: Claude 3.5 vs GPT-4o\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspect\nClaude 3.5-haiku\nGPT-4o\n\n\n\n\nStyle & Format\nBullet-point lists with numbered categories and sub-bullets.\nNarrative paragraphs with bolded section headers.\n\n\nTone\nFactual, outline-like, efficient.\nPersuasive, descriptive, brochure-like.\n\n\n1st trial\nReputation, research opportunities, faculty, funding, networking, interdisciplinarity, location.\nInterdisciplinary approach, renowned faculty, research, professional development, community/collaboration.\n\n\n2nd trial\nAdds career outcomes (tenure-track, alumni network), critical & innovative thinking, and media/tech focus.\nAdds cultural context (Philadelphia‚Äôs diversity), collegial environment, professional development, broader academic focus areas.\n\n\n3rd trial\nStrong on funding competitiveness, diverse faculty, interdisciplinary flexibility, professional networks.\nHighlights impactful research early, strong funding support, networking, and collaborative community.\n\n\nStrengths\nBroad coverage of practical factors (funding, alumni, career prospects).\nRich detail on student experience, academic culture, and research environment.\n\n\nOverall Feel\nFact sheet ‚Äì compact, informative, career-oriented.\nBrochure ‚Äì polished, engaging, student-experience focused.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to Decide Which to Use\n\nIf you need efficiency, structure, or raw ideas üëâ Claude 3.5\nIf you need polish, flow, or persuasive storytelling üëâ GPT-4o\nSometimes, the best workflow is hybrid! Start with Claude 3.5 to get a structured draft/outline. Feed that into GPT-4o to turn it into a polished narrative.\n\n\n\n‚ú® Insight for Your Future Tasks\nSince I am a PhD student, I‚Äôll face a mix of analytical tasks and communicative tasks.\n\nFor research synthesis, brainstorming frameworks, and organizing literature, Claude‚Äôs style will save my time.\nFor grant writing, papers, teaching materials, or public-facing work, GPT-4o‚Äôs fluency will help you connect with my audience.\n\nüëâ You might think of them like two tools in your research toolbox:\n\nClaude = bullet-pointed notebook üìù\nGPT-4o = polished essay draft üìñ"
