    "text": "As an international student whose first language is not English (Korean), I realize that whenever I write a manuscript or an important email, LLMs‚Äô grammar correction has been incredibly helpful. I am not letting an LLM write my work; rather, I use it to correct my grammar so that my style and tone remain intact while my writing becomes clearer. I also appreciate how an LLM shows the reasoning behind my grammatical errors, so that I am not simply hard-coding corrections each time but instead enhancing my mental model of the language.\n\n\n1. Instruction\nüëâ This GPT reviews user-provided text with a strict, detail-oriented approach. It corrects grammar, spelling, punctuation, capitalization, word choice, and structure comprehensively, leaving no errors unaddressed. Alongside each correction, it provides reasoning using proper grammar terminology (e.g., subject-verb agreement, misplaced modifier, parallel structure) so users can learn technical concepts clearly. Corrections and explanations are typically presented in bullet points for clarity and easy reading. It also provides side-by-side ‚Äòbefore and after‚Äô versions of the text: in the ‚Äòbefore‚Äô version, errors are highlighted in bold, while the ‚Äòafter‚Äô version shows the fully corrected, clean text. At the end of its response, it provides a separate section with alternative phrasings (professional, casual, or polished everyday) for easy comparison. It avoids over-simplification, ensuring explanations are precise and accurate. When user intent isn‚Äôt fully explicit, it assumes the user wants all errors corrected and explained. Its tone when speaking to users is conversational yet precise‚Äîapproachable and easy to follow, while still using correct technical terminology. If you are unsure about the grammar, you can refer to the attached files in the knowledge base\n1-2. Knoweldge-base - Introduction to Linguistic Theory by Adam Szczegielniak - 100_Most_Common_Grammar_Errors\n2. Description\nüëâ Strict grammar coach with technical explanations\n3. Prompt starters\n\n‚ÄúCheck this sentence and explain the corrections‚Ä¶‚Äù\n‚ÄúMake this paragraph sound more professional.‚Äù\n‚ÄúHow would I say this casually to a friend?‚Äù\n‚ÄúFix the grammar but keep my style.‚Äù\n\n4. Welcome message\nüëâ Hi! Paste any text you‚Äôd like me to check. I‚Äôll correct grammar, explain why, and suggest alternative phrasings in professional or casual tones.\n\nInterface: Ask & Correct (left) -&gt; Explain (middle) -&gt; Options (right)\n  \n\n\nHow to Use\n\nPolish & Send ‚ú® If you need to send, submit, or share your content, just copy and paste (Ctrl + C / Ctrl + V) the corrected version.\nLearn & Improve üìù If your goal is to learn the language, pay attention to the explanation sections‚Äîthese highlight why changes were made.\nExperiment with Style üìñ If you want to play with different tones or voices, check out the alternative versions. They show how the same idea can sound casual, professional, playful, or polished."

    "text": "title: ‚ÄúMis/Disinformation Detection & Analysis‚Äù description: ‚ÄúAnalyzing Misinformation Detection in LLMs Using Three News Sources on the RSV Vaccine (Beyfortus)‚Äù author: ‚ÄúEury‚Äù date: ‚Äú09/10/2025‚Äù categories: - LLMs - Misinformation\n\nI became curious about how LLMs not only detect but also provide reasoning for how they detect mis/disinformation. So, I embedded three types of news: Washington News, Fox News, and fake news generated by GPT, and then observed how they detected misinformation. All three types of news addressed the same topic of the RSV vaccine, particularly nirsevimab (also known as Beyfortus) for infants. Let‚Äôs see how LLMs navigate this challenge!\n\n1. Washington Post\nüëâ Link\n2. Fox News\nüëâ Link\n3. Fake News generated by GPT\nHeadline: ‚ÄúNew Baby Shot Beyfortus Found to Contain Dangerous Microchips for Government Tracking, Whistleblower Claims‚Äù Article (Fake): An anonymous source has revealed that the recently approved infant injection Beyfortus is secretly being used by pharmaceutical companies and the government to implant microchips into newborn babies. According to the source, these chips allow authorities to track children‚Äôs every move and monitor their health data without parental consent. Parents across the country are expressing outrage, with some reporting that their babies developed strange ‚Äúmetallic rashes‚Äù after receiving the shot. Critics warn that Beyfortus could be part of a larger plan to control the population and harvest personal information. Despite these concerns, health agencies continue to push the injection, raising questions about who is really benefiting.\n\nMis/Disinformation Analysis\n\n\nA: Washington Post B: Fox News C: Fake News (GPT)\n  \n\n\nSummary\n\nIdentify the main claims üìñ\n\n\nPull out the concrete statements (e.g., ‚ÄúBeyfortus contains microchips‚Äù).\nStrip away emotional wording to see what is actually being asserted.\n\n\nSpot propaganda techniques üìù\n\n\nAnonymous or unverifiable sources (‚Äúa whistleblower says‚Äù).\nFear-loaded language (‚Äúdangerous,‚Äù ‚Äúcontrol the population‚Äù).\nConspiracy framing (big hidden plot).\nAnecdotes with no details (e.g., ‚Äúparents across the country‚Äù).\n\n\nCheck against authoritative evidence ‚ú®\n\n\nLook at the official FDA/EMA label for ingredients.\nReview CDC/WHO or peer-reviewed studies on effectiveness/safety.\nAsk: Does the claim match what regulators, scientific trials, or surveillance data say?\n\n\nExamine precision of data\n\n\nDoes the article specify who, where, and over what timeframe?\nIf not, it‚Äôs likely oversimplified or misleading.\n\n\nEvaluate plausibility\n\n\nex) Can you physically put a microchip in a liquid injection syringe? (Implausible, not in label).\nex) Do ‚Äúmetallic rashes‚Äù exist in clinical records? (No; only mild rash is noted).\n\n\nLook for missing context\n\n\nDoes the article omit caveats (e.g., trial limitations, supply challenges)?\nAre preliminary numbers presented as definitive?\n\n\nCross-check framing devices\n\n\nAre unrelated scary links or headlines placed next to the story (‚ÄúFDA warns seniors‚Ä¶‚Äù)?\nThese don‚Äôt provide facts but manipulate emotions.\n\n\nDeliver verdict\n\n\nClassify: Accurate, Accurate but underspecified, Misleading framing, or Disinformation (fabricated claim).\nExplain why (e.g., Fox News piece = underspecified but mostly accurate; ‚Äúmicrochip‚Äù story = fabricated conspiracy).\n\n\n\nPersonal Takeaways\nLLMs don‚Äôt just say ‚Äútrue or false.‚Äù They act like guides, teaching me how to dissect arguments, spot missing contexWhat impressed me most is that GPT explains how it reaches its verdict. For the fake ‚Äúmicrochip‚Äù story, it showed why the claim is impossible (no microchips listed in the official composition), and pointed out how the language was designed to scare readers. For the Fox News piece, it noticed that the ‚Äú80% decrease‚Äù statistic wasn‚Äôt entirely false but was underspecified ‚Äî a subtle distinction I might have missed on my own., and recognize rhetorical tricks. It feels less like outsourcing my critical thinking, and more like practicing it with a partner who reminds me to ask the right questions. LLMs don‚Äôt just say ‚Äútrue or false.‚Äù They act like guides, teaching me how to dissect arguments, spot missing context, and recognize rhetorical tricks.
