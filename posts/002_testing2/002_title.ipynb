    "> I realized I am the only PhD student in this class. That motivated me to dive deeper into my PhD program at Annenberg. I tried two versions of **chat.asc.upenn.edu, which I discovered after attending Professor Matt‚Äôs AI workshop** a couple of days ago. The workshop was amazing, so I thought‚Äîwhy not do a little exploration of what I learned! I asked it **what the good things are about the Annenberg PhD program**. Let‚Äôs see what it gives. Also, I wasn‚Äôt familiar with the Haiku version‚Äîthe name gives off more poetic vibes, so I wanted to explore whether that‚Äôs true or not. We shall see."
