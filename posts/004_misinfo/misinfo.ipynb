    "> I became curious about how LLMs not only detect but also provide reasoning for how they detect mis/disinformation. So, I embedded three types of news: Washington News, Fox News, and fake news generated by GPT, and then observed how they detected misinformation. All three types of news addressed the same topic of the RSV vaccine, particularly nirsevimab (also known as Beyfortus) for infants. Let‚Äôs see how LLMs navigate this challenge!"

According to the source, these chips allow authorities to track children‚Äôs every move and monitor their health data without parental consent. Parents across the country are expressing outrage, with some reporting that their babies developed strange ‚Äúmetallic rashes‚Äù after receiving the shot. Critics warn that Beyfortus could be part of a larger plan to control the population and harvest personal information. Despite these concerns, health agencies continue to push the injection, raising questions about who is really benefiting."
